**Abstract**

Random search theories predict that animals employ movement patterns
that optimize encounter rates with target resources. However, animals
are not always able to achieve the optimal random search. Energy
depletion, for example, limits searchers’ movement activities, forcing
them to adjust their behaviors before and after the encounters. Here we
quantified the cost of mate search in a termite, *Reticulitermes
speratus*, and revealed that the cost reduces the selectivity of mating
partners. After a dispersal flight, termites keep searching for a mating
partner; otherwise, they die. We found that their movement activity and
diffusiveness progressively declined over observational days. Our
data-based simulations qualitatively confirmed that this reduced
movement diffusiveness decreased the searching efficiency. Also,
termites with prolonged search periods had lower colony foundation
success and fewer offspring. Thus, mate search imposes doubled costs on
termites. Finally, we found that termites with an extended mate search
reduced the selectivity of mating partners, where males immediately
paired with any encountering females and even frequently exhibited
same-sex pairing. Thus, termites dramatically changed their mate search
behavior depending on their physiological conditions. It is essential to
account for the searchers’ internal states to fill the gap between
random search theories and empirical behavioral observations.

**Introduction**

Random search strategy. What is the best movement for encounters?

Upon encounters, animals make decision. I’m mate search, there is a mate
choice.

Enhancing mating encounter is critical before encounter, while
evaluation of mating partner will be involved after encounter. Because
movement patterns influence the frequency of mating encounter, it also
has a strong influence on the subsequent decision. However, the
relationships between moving patterns and mate choice remains totally
unknown.

However, animals cannot always achieve the movement patterns

However, in random search theories, indigenous conditions of searching
agents have rarely been taken into account. This limits the connectivity
between theories of random search and empirical observations of animal
searching behaviors.

To fill this gap,

Reticulitermes. Termites are ideal system to study this. During certain
season of the year, alates fly to disperse for mating. After dispersal,
termites shed their wings and walk to search for mating partners.
Termites perform random walk to search for partners and their searching
strategy is optimized to entrance encounters according to the
conditions. If termites failed in finding partners, this mate search can
last over multiple days. Because termites are social animals, being
alone incurs a cost. This, extended mate search is expected to change
their both searching strategies and mate choice decisions.

Movement patterns. Diffusiveness is important parameters. Pausing is
too. All of them can be obtained using servosphere.

In total, we observed 166 heterosexual tandem runs (76 with nestmates
and 90 with non-

nestmates), 36 male-male tandem runs (seven with nestmates and 29 with
non-nestmates), one

female-female tandem run (with non-nestmates), and 16 tandems with \>3
individuals. We found no

significant differences in the number of tandem runs between nestmate
and non-nestmates in

heterosexual tandems (GLM with Poisson distribution, χ21 = 1.182, P =
0.277), while non-nestmate

tandems were more frequent than nestmate tandems in male-male tandems
(GLM with Poisson

distribution, χ21 = 14.439, P \< 0.001, effect size: non-nestmate -
nestmate = 2.035).

These results show the followings. First, there was no clear inbreeding
avoidance in R. speratus

heterosexual pairing. Second, we found more non-nestmate tandems than
nestmate tandems in

male-male pairing, and thus our results in the main text (and Fig. S2)
may underestimate the

stability of male-male tandem runs. Males of male-male tandems compete
over the follower

positions (Video S1), and the larger male generally wins (1). In
non-nestmate male-male pairing,

the body size difference between partners is greater than in nestmate
male-male pairing.

Differences in body size may facilitate the stability of same-sex tandem
runs in males, which should

be confirmed in future studies. Finally, female-female tandem is much
rarer than ma

Cross species variation. Some species should be less choosy. While
others can be somewhat choosy. However, everything could be secondary
because most important is to make a pair. This, it is surprising that
termites might refrain pairing with a partner for the first several
minutes. This indicates choosing better partners could provide enough
strong advantages for colony foundation success. Not that several
studies show that termites with some characters are strong candidate of
mating pairs, larger body size, without leaking body parts, microbial
community, heterozygosity, and so on. However, it is questionable how
termites can distinguish these partners, given that they even do not
care the species of their partners. Their interindividual interactions
are mostly limited in touching with antenna. Passive selection, e.g.,
strong candidate are better at tandem run, may be a cause of assistive
mating, rather than active mate choice.

**Material and Methods**

*Termite*

We collected *R. speratus* alates with a piece of nesting wood from
seven colonies in Kyoto in May 2016 and 2017. May is the swarming season
of this species in Kyoto. To control flight timing, all nesting wood
pieces were maintained at 20°C until experiments. Before each
experiment, we transferred nests to a room at 25°C, which promoted
alates to emerge and fly. Alates were then collected and separated by
sex. We used individuals who shed their wings by themselves. We stayed
all experiments within 24 hours after the swarming flight.

*Change of searching activity over time*

We investigated how searching activities change according to time after
swarming flight using three colonies collected in 2016. We investigated
the search activity of nine females and nine males (three from three
colonies). Each individual was placed on an omnidirectional servosphere
(Nagaya et al., 2017) and freely walked on an infinite two-dimensional
surface for 30 minutes. The observation was performed four times every
24 hours, i.e., just after swarming (= day 0), day 1, day 2, and day 3.
Termites were individually maintained in a Petri dish (φ = 90 mm) with a
moistened piece of filter paper (a quarter of 70 mm). The bottom of the
dish was polished so that termites could walk smoothly on the dish. We
maintained each termite under the light condition of 16L8D and at 25°C
during the interval of each observation. The observations were performed
during the time of light conditions.

Because the sampling rates of data acquisition were not constant in our
servosphere, we smoothed the coordinates data with a median filter (k
=5) and interpolated them to obtain the coordinates every 0.2 seconds
(5Hz). We removed data for the first five minutes and used the rest for
25 minutes for further analysis.

First, we obtained the moved distance every 0.2 seconds (steplength). By
summing up these steplengths, we calculated the total distances termites
walked during 25 minutes. Also, we examinied pausing duration during
this period. In *Reticulitermes speratus*, the previous study estimated
that the threshold for moving and pausing was 0.7mm (Mizumoto and
Dobata, 2019); termites are regarded as moving if they moved more than
0.7mm in 0.2 seconds, while they are pausing if less than 0.7mm. We
measured the total pausing duration during 25 minutes observations.
Then, we investigated the effect of time after swarming on walking
distracts and pausing durations, using linear mixed models (LLM) that
includes time after swarming (0, 1, 2, and 3 days after swarming), sex,
and their interactions as fixed effects, and the original colony as the
random effect (random intercept). The statistical significance of each
variable was tested using the chi-square test (type II ANOVA), herein,
and the following statistical analysis.

Second, we evaluated the diffusive properties of individual movements.
High diffusiveness is critical for the efficiency of random search when
the targets are randomly distributed and searchers do not have any prior
information on tagets (James et al., 2008; Mizumoto et al., 2017a),
which is relevant for termite mate search before encounters (Fig. 1A)
(Mizumoto and Dobata, 2019). We computed the mean squared displacements
(MSD) to compare the diffusive properties of individual movements across
time after swarming. The MSD is defined as the mean of squared distance
that an organism travels from its starting location to another point
during a given time, τ. We obtained MSD in the rang of 0.2 \< τ \< 1500,
using the function *computeMSD*() in the package “flowcatchR”. To
compare the MSD between time after swarming, we used a LMM, where τ,
time after swarming, sex, and their interactions were included as fixed
effects, and individual ids nested within original colonies were
included as a random effect (random intercept). MSD and τ were log
transformed before the LMM fitting.

*Evaluation of searching efficiency*

Because termites moved less distances with less diffusive properties and
a lot of pauses (Fig. 1B-E), searching efficiency is expected to reduce
according to extended mate search. To quantify the searching efficiency,
we used a data-based simulation approach. We projected trajectories of a
female and a male after randomization and calculated if and when they
encountered. When mate search of termites extended to multiple days,
they synchronize their search efforts with the following swarming events
(Mizumoto et al., 2017b). Given that most termites do not extend mate
search for multiple days due to pairing or predation (Mizumoto et al.,
2016), we expect that mating encounters of extended mate searchers are
usually with new mate searchers (day 0 individuals). Thus, we
investigated the encounter efficiency in the combinations of 0 day-0
day, 0 day-1 day, 0 day-2 day, and 0 day-3 day trajectories. We picked
up one trajectory with 5 FPS of a female and a male and place them at a
random location in a periodic boundary condition of size = *L* × *L*.
Each trajectory was horizontally and vertically reversed with the
probability of 1/2. Following inversion, we rotated the trajectory at
random degrees from 0 to 360 around the starting point of the
trajectory. After projecting two trajectories, we estimated if and when
these two individuals encountered. We regarded they encountered when two
are within the distance φ at the same time. We performed this process
100,000 times for eight cominations (0 day-0 day, 0 day-1 day, 0 day-2
day, and 0 day-3 day, for female-male and male-female). The parameter φ
value was set as 7 mm, based on the body size of *R. speratus* (Mizumoto
and Dobata, 2019), and *L* as 223.6, based on the previous studies
(Kusaka and Matsuura, 2017; Mizumoto and Dobata, 2019).

*Fitness cost of extended mate starch*

We investigated the cost of extended mate search using four colonies
collected in 2017. We prepared termite females and males that were
isolated for 72 hours in a Petri dish described above. After 72 hours of
isolated mate search, these termites were paired with each other.
Similarly, we also prepared pairs of termites just after swarming. Each
pair was introduced to a Petri dish (40 mm) filed with mixed sawdust in
a depth of 5mm (more explanation on mixed sawdust). Termites excavated
into the sawdust to establish their nests. All pairs were produced using
nestmate. We prepared 12 pairs for each condition in colony A, B, And C,
and 9 pairs for colony D. As several individuals were dead during 72
hours isolated mate search, we had 45 pairs for just after swarming and
39 pairs after 72 hours of matter search, in total.

All dish were maintained at 25℃ in dark condition for 60 days. After 60
days, we opened all dish and counted the number of individuals for each
caste separately (female, male, larvae, and eggs). We defined that the
pair succeed in colony foundation only when both female and male were
surviving. We compared colony foundation success between just after
swarming and 72 hours after swarming, using a generalised linear mixed
model (GLMM) with binomial distribution and logic link function, in
which termite condition was included as fixed effect, while original
colony was included as random effect (random intercept).

Next, among pairs that succeeded in colony foundation, we compared the
number of eggs and larvae between termite conditions. We used a GLMM
with Poisson distribution.

The effect of extended searching on mate choice

We investigated how extended mate search affect the pairing dynamics,
using colonies collected in 2016. After swarming, 10 females and 10
males of dealate were selected from two different colonies. These 40
individuals were paint marked with one colored on the abdomen for sex
and colony identification (PX-20; Mitsubishi). All 40 individuals were
maintained for 30 min (just after swarming) or 72 hours (extended mate
search) separately in a 24 well plate before the observation. The
results of 30 minutes treatment are reported in Mizumoto et al. 2022. We
introduced 40 individuals to the experimental arena (ø=600mm). The
experimental arena consisted of a Styrofoam board (600 x 600 mm) and a
circular plastic tube (ø=600mm, height = 100mm). After being introduced
in the arena, we observed termite movements for 30 minutes within a part
of the experimental arena (200 x 100 mm) located at the edge of the
circular arena. We did so because most individuals walked along the edge
of the arena, repeatedly passing across the observational arena. We
counted the number of individuals passing across the observational area
with their status (single individuals, heterosexual tandems, same-sex
tandems, tandems with \>3 individuals). We performed the experiments six
times with different colony combinations (SA-SB, SA-SC, SB-SC, SD-SE,
SD-SF, SE-SF) for each treatment. The experimental arena was cleaned
with 70% ethanol and distilled water before each experiment.

We compared the number of observation of pairing units, using Wilcoxon
signed rank test. Also, we compared the number of observation of
nestmate pairs and non-nest mate pairs. Finally, we investigated the
time development of observed tandem running pairs. We binned our 30
minutes observation into 0-5 minutes, 5-10 minutes, …, 25-30 minutes and
counted the number of observed tandem pairs during each time window.
Then, we used spearman’s rank relation test to examine the time
developments of the number of observed tandem running pairs.

All analysis were performed by R v4.3.1 with libraries of
“exactRankTests”、 “lme4”、”car”.
