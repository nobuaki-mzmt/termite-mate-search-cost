**Abstract**

Random search theories predict that animals employ movement patterns
that optimize encounter rates with target resources. However, animals
are not always able to achieve the optimal random search. Energy
depletion, for example, limits searchers’ movement activities, forcing
them to adjust their behaviors before and after the encounters. Here we
quantified the cost of mate search in a termite, *Reticulitermes
speratus*, and revealed that the cost reduces the selectivity of mating
partners. After a dispersal flight, termites keep searching for a mating
partner; otherwise, they die. We found that their movement activity and
diffusiveness progressively declined over observational days. Our
data-based simulations qualitatively confirmed that this reduced
movement diffusiveness decreased the searching efficiency. Also,
termites with prolonged search periods had lower colony foundation
success and fewer offspring. Thus, mate search imposes doubled costs on
termites. Finally, we found that termites with an extended mate search
reduced the selectivity of mating partners, where males immediately
paired with any encountering females and even frequently exhibited
same-sex pairing. Thus, termites dramatically changed their mate search
behavior depending on their physiological conditions. It is essential to
account for the searchers’ internal states to fill the gap between
random search theories and empirical behavioral observations.

**Introduction**

Random search strategy. What is the best movement for encounters?

Upon encounters, animals make decision. I’m mate search, there is a mate
choice.

Enhancing mating encounter is critical before encounter, while
evaluation of mating partner will be involved after encounter. Because
movement patterns influence the frequency of mating encounter, it also
has a strong influence on the subsequent decision. However, the
relationships between moving patterns and mate choice remains totally
unknown.

However, animals cannot always achieve the movement patterns

However, in random search theories, indigenous conditions of searching
agents have rarely been taken into account. This limits the connectivity
between theories of random search and empirical observations of animal
searching behaviors.

To fill this gap,

Reticulitermes. Termites are ideal system to study this. During certain
season of the year, alates fly to disperse for mating. After dispersal,
termites shed their wings and walk to search for mating partners.
Termites perform random walk to search for partners and their searching
strategy is optimized to entrance encounters according to the
conditions. If termites failed in finding partners, this mate search can
last over multiple days. Because termites are social animals, being
alone incurs a cost. This, extended mate search is expected to change
their both searching strategies and mate choice decisions.

Movement patterns. Diffusiveness is important parameters. Pausing is
too. All of them can be obtained using servosphere.

**Results**

**Change of searching activity over time**

After the swarming flights, both females and males actively move to
search for a mating partner in *R. speratus* (Mizumoto and Dobata,
2019). However, according to time, the search activity was progressively
reduced (Fig. 1B). Traveled distances during 25 minutes observations
were significantly declined according to observational day **(**LMM,
LRT, day: χ<sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub> = 98.9, *P* \< 0.001, Fig. 1C), with
females moving more distances than males (χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> =
4.5, *P* = 0.033). Similarly, both females and males paused for a longer
duration according to observational day **(**LMM, LRT, day:
χ<sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub> = 71.7, *P* \< 0.001, Fig. 1D), with no sexual
differences **(**χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 1.84, *P* = 0.17, Fig. 1D).
This difference of movement activities turned out the different
diffusive properties of termites. Termites just after swarming had the
largest MSD, and the value of MSD decreased according to days after
swarming (LMM, LRT, day: χ<sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub> = 398.9, *P* \<
0.001, Fig. 1E). Note that the slopes did not change according to
observation days in termites (LMM, LRT, interactions between day and τ:
χ<sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub> = 5.89, *P* = 0.11), indicating that the
decrease of MSD was caused by changes of movement activities, such as
movement speed and pausing duration, rather than the type of random
walks, e.g., changes of turning patterns or Lévy walk properties.
Therefore, the observed behavioral changes did not reflect the changes
of random search strategies but inactivity of termites, perhaps caused
by energy depletion.

When termites search for a mating partner, whose location is unknown to
searchers, high diffusiveness is critical for the encounter efficiency
(Mizumoto and Dobata, 2019), as shown in theoretical studies on random
search when the targets are randomly distributed and searchers do not
have any prior information on targets (James et al., 2008; Mizumoto et
al., 2017a). Because termites moved less distances with less diffusive
properties with longer pauses (Fig. 1B-E), searching efficiency is
expected to reduce according to extended mate search. Accordngly, our
data-based simulations demonstrated that searching efficiency of
termites was progressively reduced according to observation days (Fig.
1F). In both females and males, searching efficiency was highest in
termites just after the swarming, which showed the highest diffusive
properties (Fig. 1EF), and lowest in termites after 3 days that had the
lowest diffusive properties (Fig. 1EF).

*Fitness cost of extended mate starch*

We found that extended mating search incurs the cost on colony
foundation success. The colony foundation success was significantly
reduced in termite pairs that experienced 3 days extended search,
compared with those found a colony just after swarming (GLMM, LRT, sex:
χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 4.02, *P* = 0.04; Fig. 2B). Also, even after
the successful colony foundations, pairs with extended mate search had
the significantly smaller number of offspring (GLMM, LRT, sex:
χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 4.14, *P* = 0.04, Fig. 2C).

In total, we observed 166 heterosexual tandem runs (76 with nestmates
and 90 with non-nestmates), 36 male-male tandem runs (seven with
nestmates and 29 with non-nestmates), onefemale-female tandem run (with
non-nestmates), and 16 tandems with \>3 individuals. We found no
significant differences in the number of tandem runs between nestmate
and non-nestmates in heterosexual tandems (GLM with Poisson
distribution, χ21 = 1.182, P = 0.277), while non-nestmate tandems were
more frequent than nestmate tandems in male-male tandems (GLM with
Poisson distribution, χ21 = 14.439, P \< 0.001, effect size:
non-nestmate - nestmate = 2.035). These results show the followings.
First, there was no clear inbreeding avoidance in R. speratus
heterosexual pairing. Second, we found more non-nestmate tandems than
nestmate tandems in male-male pairing, and thus our results in the main
text (and Fig. S2) may underestimate the stability of male-male tandem
runs. Males of male-male tandems compete over the follower positions
(Video S1), and the larger male generally wins (1). In non-nestmate
male-male pairing, the body size difference between partners is greater
than in nestmate male-male pairing. Differences in body size may
facilitate the stability of same-sex tandem runs in males, which should
be confirmed in future studies. Finally, female-female tandem is much
rarer than ma

**Discussion**

Mate search incurs the doubled costs to termites. First, termites
traveled less distance and discounted the diffusive properties after the
extended mate seach peridod (Fig. 1). As fast and diffusive movements
are beneficial to increase encounter efficiency in termite mate search
(Mizumoto and Dobata, 2019), reductuion of movement capacity decreases
mating encounters (Fig. 1F). Such inactivity of termites with extended
mate search could be caused by the energy depletion (Wickman and
Jansson, 1997) because termite reprductives use reserved fat body for
dispersal flight and colony foundations and do not obtain further energy
until they successful start establishing the new colonies (refs).
Therefore, energy costs associated with mate search further decreased
the colony foundation successes and the number of offspering after
foundations.

このように、通常は社会性で集団の中に生きるシロアリにとって、単独で他個体を探索するという行動が長引くことは、大きな適応度上のコストである。このような探索にかかる適応度上のコストは、配偶者選択に大きな影響を与えた。アリーナ内でタンデム行動の観察を行ったところ、群飛直後の個体と比べ、3
日間探索した個体では、多くのタンデム歩行が見られた（図 9-4）。また 2
個体のオスが 1 個体のメスを巡って争う 3
個体以上のタンデムも多く観察できた（図
9-4）。このような配偶者選択の変化は、複数回交尾をよく行う種でもみられ、メスによるオスの配偶者選択が行われる種において、この時メスの残り寿命が短い
(Wilson et al. 2010; Wilgers and Hebets 2012)、オスの密度が低い (Alatalo
et al. 1988)、繁殖可能な期間が短い (Gotthard et al.
1999)などにより、探索にかかるコストが大きくなる場合には、メスの選り好みが緩和されることが知られている。本研究では、このような探索コストを被ることに伴う配偶者選択の緩和が、一夫一妻の種において見られることを示した。これはシロアリの配偶者選択においても性選択が重要な役割を果たしていることを示唆する。

タンデム行動の観測数の時間変化においても、群飛直後と 3
日間の探索後で大きな違いが見られた。群飛直後の個体では、観察時間の経過に伴って観測されるタンデムの数が増加した一方、3
日経過ではそのような増加は見られず、最初からタンデムの観測数は多かった（図
9-4）。これは次の様に解釈できる。群飛直後のオスは、まだ自身の探索行動に余裕があるため、複数のメスを評価してから質の高いメスを選択する。一方で、3
日間探索したオスは、自身の探索行動に余裕がないため、質にかかわらず出会ったメスを選択する。というものである。このような現象は、最適停止問題の

人と順番にお見合いするとして、何人目の相手と交際すると最も好みである人と交際できるかを考える問題である
(Ferguson 1989)。この解は k = n/e
人目までを無条件で断り、それ以降で一番条件の良いパートナーで選ぶものである。群飛直後は、これからまだ多くの相手と出会うことがあできると予測されるまで、k
が大きな値となり、初期にはタンデムを行わず相手を評価するだけである。そして、出会った個体の数が増えてくると、タンデムを行うことを決め始める個体が出てくるため、時間の経過に応じてタンデムの数は増加する。一方で、3
日間他個体と出会うことができなかった個体にとっては、k
はかなり小さい値となる。そのため、無条件で断ることがなくなり、初期段階から多くのタンデム行動がみられる。このようにシロアリは、配偶者探索におけるSequential
choice model の実証に適した材料である (Real 1990; Real 1991)。

探索効率の最適化について、空間的、時間的な最適戦略を探る研究では、本章で検討したような個体の状態が考慮されることはほとんどない。本研究で示した、探索活動を行うことそのものが、活動量やその後の配偶者選択にも影響を及ぼすという視点を組み合わせると、生物の移動パターンの進化についてより深い議論が可能になるだろう

Cross species variation. Some species should be less choosy. While
others can be somewhat choosy. However, everything could be secondary
because most important is to make a pair. This, it is surprising that
termites might refrain pairing with a partner for the first several
minutes. This indicates choosing better partners could provide enough
strong advantages for colony foundation success. Not that several
studies show that termites with some characters are strong candidate of
mating pairs, larger body size, without leaking body parts, microbial
community, heterozygosity, and so on. However, it is questionable how
termites can distinguish these partners, given that they even do not
care the species of their partners. Their interindividual interactions
are mostly limited in touching with antenna. Passive selection, e.g.,
strong candidate are better at tandem run, may be a cause of assistive
mating, rather than active mate choice.

**Material and Methods**

*Termite*

We collected *R. speratus* alates with a piece of nesting wood from
seven colonies in Kyoto in May 2016 and 2017. May is the swarming season
of this species in Kyoto. To control flight timing, all nesting wood
pieces were maintained at 20°C until experiments. Before each
experiment, we transferred nests to a room at 25°C, which promoted
alates to emerge and fly. Alates were then collected and separated by
sex. We used individuals who shed their wings by themselves. We stayed
all experiments within 24 hours after the swarming flight.

*Change of searching activity over time*

We investigated how searching activities change according to time after
swarming flight using three colonies collected in 2016. We investigated
the search activity of nine females and nine males (three from three
colonies). Each individual was placed on an omnidirectional servosphere
(Nagaya et al., 2017) and freely walked on an infinite two-dimensional
surface for 30 minutes. The observation was performed four times every
24 hours, i.e., just after swarming (= day 0), day 1, day 2, and day 3.
Termites were individually maintained in a Petri dish (φ = 90 mm) with a
moistened piece of filter paper (a quarter of 70 mm). The bottom of the
dish was polished so that termites could walk smoothly on the dish. We
maintained each termite under the light condition of 16L8D and at 25°C
during the interval of each observation. The observations were performed
during the time of light conditions.

Because the sampling rates of data acquisition were not constant in our
servosphere, we smoothed the coordinates data with a median filter (k
=5) and interpolated them to obtain the coordinates every 0.2 seconds
(5Hz). We removed data for the first five minutes and used the rest for
25 minutes for further analysis.

First, we obtained the moved distance every 0.2 seconds (steplength). By
summing up these steplengths, we calculated the total distances termites
walked during 25 minutes. Also, we examinied pausing duration during
this period. In *Reticulitermes speratus*, the previous study estimated
that the threshold for moving and pausing was 0.7mm (Mizumoto and
Dobata, 2019); termites are regarded as moving if they moved more than
0.7mm in 0.2 seconds, while they are pausing if less than 0.7mm. We
measured the total pausing duration during 25 minutes observations.
Then, we investigated the effect of time after swarming on walking
distracts and pausing durations, using linear mixed models (LLM) that
includes time after swarming (0, 1, 2, and 3 days after swarming), sex,
and their interactions as fixed effects, and the original colony as the
random effect (random intercept). The statistical significance of each
variable was tested using the chi-square test (type II ANOVA), herein,
and the following statistical analysis.

Second, we evaluated the diffusive properties of individual movements.
High diffusiveness is critical for the efficiency of random search when
the targets are randomly distributed and searchers do not have any prior
information on tagets (James et al., 2008; Mizumoto et al., 2017a),
which is relevant for termite mate search before encounters (Fig. 1A)
(Mizumoto and Dobata, 2019). We computed the mean squared displacements
(MSD) to compare the diffusive properties of individual movements across
time after swarming. The MSD is defined as the mean of squared distance
that an organism travels from its starting location to another point
during a given time, τ. We obtained MSD in the range of 0.2 \< τ \<
1500, using the function *computeMSD*() in the package “flowcatchR”. To
compare the MSD between time after swarming, we used a LMM, where τ,
time after swarming, sex, and their interactions were included as fixed
effects, and individual ids nested within original colonies were
included as a random effect (random intercept). MSD and τ were log
transformed before the LMM fitting.

*Evaluation of searching efficiency*

Because termites moved less distances with less diffusive properties and
a lot of pauses (Fig. 1B-E), searching efficiency is expected to reduce
according to extended mate search. To quantify the searching efficiency,
we used a data-based simulation approach. We projected trajectories of a
female and a male after randomization and calculated if and when they
encountered. When mate search of termites extended to multiple days,
they synchronize their search efforts with the following swarming events
(Mizumoto et al., 2017b). Given that most termites do not extend mate
search for multiple days due to pairing or predation (Mizumoto et al.,
2016), we expect that mating encounters of extended mate searchers are
usually with new mate searchers (day 0 individuals). Thus, we
investigated the encounter efficiency in the combinations of 0 day-0
day, 0 day-1 day, 0 day-2 day, and 0 day-3 day trajectories. We picked
up one trajectory with 5 FPS of a female and a male and place them at a
random location in a periodic boundary condition of size = *L* × *L*.
Each trajectory was horizontally and vertically reversed with the
probability of 1/2. Following inversion, we rotated the trajectory at
random degrees from 0 to 360 around the starting point of the
trajectory. After projecting two trajectories, we estimated if and when
these two individuals encountered. We regarded they encountered when two
are within the distance φ at the same time. We performed this process
100,000 times for eight cominations (0 day-0 day, 0 day-1 day, 0 day-2
day, and 0 day-3 day, for female-male and male-female). The parameter φ
value was set as 7 mm, based on the body size of *R. speratus* (Mizumoto
and Dobata, 2019), and *L* as 223.6, based on the previous studies
(Kusaka and Matsuura, 2017; Mizumoto and Dobata, 2019).

*Fitness cost of extended mate starch*

We investigated the long-term fitness cost of extended mate search after
colony foundation using four colonies collected in 2017. We prepared
termite females and males that were isolated for 72 hours in a Petri
dish described above. After 72 hours of isolated mate search, these
termites were paired with each other. Similarly, we also prepared pairs
of termites just after swarming. Each pair was introduced to a Petri
dish (φ = 40 mm) filed with brown-rotted pinewood mixed cellulose medium
in a depth of 5 mm (Mitaka et al., 2023), where termites excavated into
the medium to establish their nests. All pairs were produced using
nestmate. We prepared 12 pairs for each condition in three colonies and
nine pairs for one colony. As several individuals were dead during 72
hours isolated mate search, we had 45 pairs for just after swarming and
39 pairs after 72 hours of matter search, in total.

All dish were maintained at 25℃ in dark condition for 60 days. After 60
days, we opened all dish and counted the number of surviving individuals
(female, male, larvae, and eggs, separately). We defined that the pair
succeed in colony foundation only when both female and male were
surviving. We compared colony foundation success between just after
swarming and 72 hours after swarming, using a generalised linear mixed
model (GLMM) with binomial distribution and logic link function, in
which termite condition was included as fixed effect, while original
colony was included as random effect (random intercept). We also
compared the number of eggs and larvae between termite conditions among
pairs that succeeded in colony foundation. We used a GLMM with Poisson
distribution, otherwise the same with the other one.

*Change of fresh weight and mate preference*

Fresh body weight is often used as an indicator of the quality of
termite dealates (refs), where heaviwer termites are preferred as mating
partners. We examined how body weght could change during extended mate
search and how it affected the mating preferences. Using three colonies
collected in 2016, we compared the fresh weights of eight females and
males for each colony just after swarming and after 72 hours mate
search. Measurements were performed on a scale of the 0.01 mg.

To investigate the mate preference of termites, we observed the mate
competition situations between termites just after swarming (new) and
after 72 hours mate search (old). We introduced three termite dealates
(new female-old female-new male or new female-new male-old male) in a
petri dish arena (φ = 90 mm) filled with moistened plaster. After 10
minutes of introduction, we confirmed if the new individidual waas
tandem pairing with new opposite sex indidivudal or the old individual
was pairing. We used binomial test to test the bias in pairing
combinations (old or new). All three indidivudals were from different
colonies.

*The effect of extended searching on tandem pairing occurrence*

We investigated how extended mate search affect the pairing dynamics,
using colonies collected in 2016. After swarming, ten females and ten
males of dealate were selected from two different colonies. These 40
individuals were paint marked with one colored on the abdomen for sex
and colony identification (PX-20; Mitsubishi). All 40 individuals were
maintained for 30 min (just after swarming) or 72 hours (extended mate
search) separately in a 24 well plate before the observation. Note that
the results of 30 minutes treatment were already reported in (see Text
S1 of (Mizumoto et al., 2022)).We introduced 40 individuals to the
experimental arena (ø = 600 mm). The experimental arena consisted of a
Styrofoam board (600 x 600 mm) and a circular plastic tube (ø = 600 mm,
height = 100 mm). After being introduced in the arena, we observed
termite movements for 30 minutes within a part of the experimental arena
(200 x 100 mm) located at the edge of the circular arena (Fig. S2). We
did so because most individuals walked along the edge of the arena,
repeatedly passing across the observational arena (Video S1 and S2). We
counted the number of individuals passing across the observational area
with their status (single individuals, heterosexual tandems, same-sex
tandems, tandems with \>3 individuals). We performed the experiments six
times with different colony combinations for each treatment. The
experimental arena was cleaned with 70% ethanol and distilled water
before each experiment.

We compared the total number of observation of pairing units between
termites just after swarming and after extended mate search, using
Wilcoxon signed rank test. We also investigated the time development of
observed tandem running pairs. We binned our 30 minutes observation into
0-5 minutes, 5-10 minutes, …, 25-30 minutes and counted the number of
observed tandem pairs during each time-windows. We used spearman’s rank
relation test to test if the number of observed tandem running pairs
increase according to time developments.

All analysis were performed by R v4.3.1 (R Core Team, 2023) with
libraries of “lme4”, “car”, and “exactRankTests” for statistical tests,
and “Rcpp” for data-based simulations. All data with R and Cpp scripts
